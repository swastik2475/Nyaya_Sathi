## **Project Overview**

Nyaya Sathi is an AI-powered legal assistance and learning platform designed to simplify access to legal information for students and the general public. The system uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to provide accurate, easy-to-understand answers to legal queries in a conversational manner. The primary goal of Nyaya Sathi is to improve legal literacy and reduce the complexity of understanding laws, rights, and basic legal procedures.

## **Problem Statement**

Legal information in India is often complex, difficult to understand, and inaccessible to non-lawyers. Students and common citizens struggle to interpret legal terms, rights, and procedures due to language barriers and lack of structured learning resources. Existing solutions are either too technical or require professional consultation, which is time-consuming and costly.

## **Why Nyaya Sathi**

Nyaya Sathi addresses the gap between legal knowledge and accessibility by leveraging AI. Instead of replacing legal professionals, it acts as a learning and guidance tool that helps users understand legal concepts before taking further steps. It empowers students and citizens with preliminary legal awareness, saving time and improving confidence while interacting with the legal system.
